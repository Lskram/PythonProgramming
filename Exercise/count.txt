(CNN)A lawyer representing the woman claiming Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world's biggest soccer stars, raped her in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009 has said the accusation is not "fake news."
Kathryn Mayorga says the Portuguese footballer, who now plays for Italian club Juventus, raped her while she repeatedly screamed no, according to a lawsuit filed Friday in Clark County, Nevada. After the attack, according to the lawsuit, Ronaldo apologized, "stating he was sorry, he was usually a gentleman."
